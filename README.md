# Roar: Client SDKs

[Roar Engine](http://roarengine.com) is a game mechanics platform that provides tools such as Friends, Messaging,
Quests and Tasks, Items, Shops, Gifts, Payment processing and works with Facebook (credits, graph and auth), iOS (In-App Payment)
and Google (Google+ auth, Google Wallet).  

The open source Roar SDKs are designed to provide native client access to the [Web API](http://roarengine.com/webapi/)
which can be configured using the [Admin system](http://admin.roar.io). Most of the SDKs come with pre-built downloads,
but you can also click through to each SDK (such as Unity3D) for instructions on how to build your own.

### Current SDKs: 

- **Unity3D** - [Download](https://github.com/downloads/roarengine/sdks/RoarIO.unityPackage) (Unity package) | [README]((https://github.com/roarengine/sdks/blob/master/unity/README.md)

Upcoming:

### Developers

The Roar SDKs are entirely **open source**. We encourage any developers who want to get involved to do so - 
submit issues, fork the repo, 
port to platforms and submit pull requests if you have code updates. You'll find specific information
about building for each platform in the corresponding directory README (eg. /unity3d/README.md).
